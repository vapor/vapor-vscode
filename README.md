## Requirements

This extension requires the Vapor Toolbox to be installed on your system for project creation.

> **Note**
> If you only need Leaf language support, you don't need to install the Toolbox.

On macOS and Linux, the Toolbox is distributed via Homebrew. If you do not have Homebrew yet, visit [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/) for install instructions.

```sh
brew install vapor
```

For more information and installation methods, see the [Toolbox page](https://github.com/vapor/toolbox).

## Known Issues

Formatting Leaf tags embedded in HTML attributes has some limitations.
